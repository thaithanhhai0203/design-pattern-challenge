## What's a design pattern?
Design pattern are well-established solutions for recurring problems that software engineers often encounter. They are not actual code, but rather a description of how to solve these problems and design a solution.

Design patterns function as frameworks that developers can use to solve typical architectural difficulties. They guarantee reliability and ease of code maintenance.

The purpose of design patterns is to elevate software development practices by offering standardized solutions. They are essential in organizing code, promoting reusability, and simplifying the design process. By adhering to established patterns, developers can avoid unnecessary repetition and focus more on creating efficient, high-quality applications.

Implementing design patterns in software development yields numerous benefits:
- **Code Reusability**: Design patterns encourage the reuse of proven solutions, reduce redundant code, and save valuable development time.
- **Scalability**: Design patterns provide flexible structures that can adjust to shifting needs and accommodate future expansions.
- **Maintainability**: By utilizing design patterns, code becomes more modular and easier to maintain. Developers can change specific software parts without impacting the entire application.
- **Collaboration**: Design patterns establish a widely-used language for developers, fostering effective communication and understanding of the softwareâ€™s architecture
